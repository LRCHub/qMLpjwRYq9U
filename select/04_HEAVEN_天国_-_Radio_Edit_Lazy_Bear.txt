Feels like
Feels like Heaven is in your eyes
Feels like Heaven is in your eyes
Feels like Heaven is in your eyes
So tell me how am I supposed to live
So tell me how am I supposed to breathe
Without you
I dance alone every night and day
When all the memories comeback again
When the sun shines brighter it
Feels like Heaven is in your eyes
Open Your heart, and
Feels like Heaven is in your eyes
